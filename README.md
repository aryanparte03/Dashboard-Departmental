## 💡 What’s This Project About?

Every department has its own moving parts — from pending tasks and delayed approvals to certificates waiting to be processed. These dashboards were designed to simplify the chaos:

- **Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) at a glance**
- **Track where things are stuck and who's responsible**
- **Spot trends, delays, and top performers over time**

Whether it's identifying a bottleneck or recognizing high-performing team members, this project brings **clarity to operations**.
